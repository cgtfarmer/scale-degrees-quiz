get font scaling stuff nightmares figured out
Pretty up CSS (especially the grid stuff)
do the label thing for the checkboxes
add rest of keys into html
add rest of keys into json
& get checkboxes consistently starting at correct state
# =============================================================================


For the key of C...
	Scale Degrees (scale degree, note, both)
		what note is the 3rd scale degree? E
		what scale degree is the note: F? 4

	Chord Qualities (triads, tetrads, both)
		what is the root and diatonic chord quality of triad #:
			4? F Major
			2? D Minor
			7? B Diminished

		what is the root and diatonic chord quality of tetrad #:

Allow checkboxes for any key to be randomly drawn from
Allow selections of which
